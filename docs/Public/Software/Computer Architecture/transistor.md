A *transistor* is an electrical switch in circuits. There are no moving parts. 

MOS = Metal Oxide [[semiconductor]]
There are two types of transistors: *nMOS* and *pMOS*

How they work: 
Current flows when there is an electrical difference i.e. positive to negative. When a positive voltage is applied to the gate, it attracts electrons from the substrate, making the top part of the substrate behave like it is negatively charged. Now that there is an electrical difference, the source and drain are connected, and current flows.
