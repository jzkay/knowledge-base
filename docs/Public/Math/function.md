A *function* relates an input and an output. [^1]

A *function* consists of:
- a [[set]] $A$ called the domain of the function
- a set $B$ called the codomain of the function
- a rule $f$ that assigns each $a\in A$ an element $f(a)\in B$

There are different ways to think of them:
- as rules $f$ that assigns elements of one set $X$, elements of another set $Y$
- as relations $R$ from $X$ to $Y$ where for each $x \in X$ there is one and only one $y \in Y$ such that $(x, y)$ is in $R$. 

	If $(x, y)$ is in $R$, we write $y = f(x)$.
