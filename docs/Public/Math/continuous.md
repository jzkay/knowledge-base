In simple terms, a function or variable is continuous if its graph can be drawn in one stroke with a pencil. [^1]

A function is discontinuous if there are breaks in the graph. If you have to lift your pencil, it means you made a very small movement but the function changed significantly. [^2]

*Continuous* deals with [[real numbers]] and [[complex numbers]]. It is associated with measuring physical phenomena which *continuously* change, such as mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic. [^3]
