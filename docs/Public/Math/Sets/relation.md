A *relation* $\mathbb{R}$ from $A$ to $B$ is a [[subset]] of $A\times B$. 

A *relation* $\mathbb{R}$ from $A$ to $A$ is also called a *relation* on $A$. 

A [[function]] from $A$ to $B$ is a *relation* $f$ from $A$ to $B$ such that:
- the [[domain]] of $f$ is $A$
- if $(x,y) \in f$ and $(x, z) \in f$, then $y=z$

We write $f: A \implies B$ and read:
- "f is a function from A to B"
