A *partition* of a [[set]] $A$ is a set $\Pi$ consisting of subsets of $A$ such that:
- whenever $P_1, P_2 \in \Pi$ and $P_1 \ne P_2$
- then $P_1 \cap P_2 = \emptyset$

Every $a \in A$ belongs to some $P \in \Pi$.

*Partitioning* the set is the same as having an [[equivalence relation]] on the set.
