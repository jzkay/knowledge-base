Given relations from [[set]] $A$ to $B$ and from $B$ to $C$, a *composite relation* is some relation from $A$ to $C$.

Define [[relation]] $R$ from $A$ to $B$, relation $S$ from $B$ to $C$. The *composite* of $R$ and $S$ is:
$$
S \circ R = \{ (a, c) | (\exists b \in B) (a, b) \in R \land (b, c) \in S \}
$$
