Let $A$ and $B$ be some [[set]]. The set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ such that $a\in A$ and $b \in B$ is called the *cartesian product*. 
$$
A\times B = \{(a, b)| a\in A, b\in B\}
$$
Example:
Let $A = \{m, p\}$, $B = \{5, 7, 9\}$. Then, 
$$
A\times B = \{(m, 5), (m, 7), (m, 9), (p, 5), (p, 7), (p, 9)\}
$$
