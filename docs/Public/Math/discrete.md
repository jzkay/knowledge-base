*Discrete* refers to mathematical structures that are countable or otherwise distinct and separate. [^1] 

In other words, *discrete* structures can only take certain values. For example, the number of students in class; you can't have half a student. [^2]

Examples include integers, graphs, and statements in logic. [^3]
