A *graph* is made up of multiple [[vertex]] and [[edges]] which connect them together. 

A *graph* can be thought of as a network, a way to express the relationships between pairs of items. [^1]

Formally, a *graph* consists of two finite sets, $V$ and $E$, representing vertices and edges. The elements of $E$ are unordered pairs of vertices. 

For example:
$$
V = \{a, b, c, d, e, f\}
$$
$$
E = \{(a, d), (a, e), (b, c)\}
$$
