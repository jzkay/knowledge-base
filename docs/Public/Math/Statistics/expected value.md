The *expected value*, denoted as $E[X]$ or sometimes $\micro$ of a [[random variable]] $X$ is a [[measure of center]] of its [[probability]] [[distribution]]. 

For a [[discrete]] random variable, it's calculated by summing the [[product]] of each possible value of $X$ with its probability of occurring.

$$
E[X] = \Sigma x*p(x)
