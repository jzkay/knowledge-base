*Principle of mathematical induction*, sometimes referred to as *strong mathematical induction*, is as follows:

Let $S$ be a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ with these two properties:
1. $1\in S$, and
2. for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$, if $n\in S$, then $n+1\in S$
Then $S = \mathbb{N}$.

In other words, to prove the statement: $p(n)$ is true for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$
- $p(1)$ is true (base)
- If $p(j)$ is true for all integers $1\le j \le m$, then $p(m+1)$ is true
