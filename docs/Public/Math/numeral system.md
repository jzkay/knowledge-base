A *numeral system* is a writing system for expressing numbers. Given a [[set]], a *numerical system* sets the rules for how it will be represented as numbers. [^1]

Common *numeral systems* are:
- [[binary]] 
	- The basis for all computing systems and operations; turning on and off circuits. 
- [[octal]]
- [[decimal]]
	- 
- [[hexadecimal]]
	- Used in assembly / machine code, often to represent memory addresses
