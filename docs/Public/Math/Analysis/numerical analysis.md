*Numerical analysis* is about step-by-step solutions ([[numerical method]]) to problems involving [[real numbers]] and [[complex numbers]]. [^1] 

In other words, it is the rigorous study of approximately solving [[continuous]] math problems using a computer. 

"Pretend you're reinventing the calculator. How can you efficiently calculate such-and-such function while guaranteeing the error is small?" [^1]
