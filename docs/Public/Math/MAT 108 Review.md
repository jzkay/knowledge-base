Part 1

Axiomatic Mathematics
- Prove using [[axiom]]

Mathematical Logic
- Truth tables
- English sentences and manipulation of those (unless, ...))
- ![[negation]], ![[contrapositive]], ![[converse]]

Quantifiers:
- For every: ![[universal quantification]]
- Exists: ![[existential quantification]]
  
Proof techniques:
- Proof by contradiction

![[principle of mathematical induction]]
- Standard
- Generalized
- Strong / complete induction

Well-ordering principle

Part 2

Zeckendorf's Theorem

Sets
- ![[union]]
- ![[set difference]]
- ![[product]]
- ![[intersection]]

Relations

'Prove for all numbers, p(x) is divisible by n'

- Modular arithmetic

[[relation]]

- Union, intersection
- inverse, equivalence

- ![[reflexivity]], ![[symmetry]], ![[transivity]]
[[knowledge-base/docs/Public/Math/function|function]]
- examples / constructions
- 1-1 / onto / bijections
- Functions as relations
	- Composition / Inverse relation
- Relation, codomain
- Well-defined or not
- Symmetry
	- Nodes will point to itself
	- Edges are bidirectional
	- If I can find a connection, then everything else in it is connected
- Equivalence relations are the same as relations
