This is a work-in-progress, I am currently using a template from this [repo](https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs) to publish my Obsidian Vault onto Github Pages. It is a free solution in the meantime; I may look for better looking alternatives in the future, but for now, there is now a place on the internet for my Knowledge Base.
